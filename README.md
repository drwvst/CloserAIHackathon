# CloserAI Hackathon Project

## Our team is building an agentic web application that helps users quickly determine whether a home listing is financially feasible for them. By pasting in a Zillow or comparable housing listing URL, the system automatically extracts relevant property details and combines them with the user’s financial inputs. A set of reasoning agents then evaluates affordability, risk, and purchase readiness and returns a clear, actionable answer on whether the home is realistically within reach and why.
